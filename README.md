Status: archive. Some work in F0 estimation, using persistent homology and various techniques from signal processing.

This work is part of my senior project from a few years ago. It's hacky "academic" code, far from production quality. I don't have any intent to continue this project, and there's many things that I would do differently now. 


Code can be found in /scripts:
* wave_predictors.py contains the main models (predictors) used.
* wavedata.py contains the main data structures.
* Other scripts contain various utilities: audio hacks, i/o, and model training.

More information can be found within the full writeup: honors_thesis_final.pdf.
